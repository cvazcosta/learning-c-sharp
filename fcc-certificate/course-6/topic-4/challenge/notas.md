# Challenge goal

Produce the following output:

```Plain Text
ehT kciuq nworb xof spmuj revo eht yzal god
```

This is a particularly difficult challenge.

You will need to combine many of the concepts you learned in this exercise, including the use of the `Split()`, `ToCharArray()`, `Array.Reverse()`, and `String.Join()`.

You'll also need to create multiple arrays, and at least one iteration statement.
