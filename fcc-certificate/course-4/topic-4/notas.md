# Code challenge - implement the FizzBuzz challenge rules

Here are the FizzBuzz rules that you need to implement in your code project:

- Output values from 1 to 100, one number per line, inside the code block of an iteration statement.
- When the current value is divisible by 3, print the term Fizz next to the number.
- When the current value is divisible by 5, print the term Buzz next to the number.
- When the current value is divisible by both 3 and 5, print the term FizzBuzz next to the number.
