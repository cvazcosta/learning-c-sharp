# Task List

- [x] Code review: review the contents of the Program.cs file.
- [x] Sample data: convert the if-elseif-else structure to switch-case structure that improves readability.
- [x] Menu loop: enclose the main menu and menu item selection in a loop that iterates until the user enters "exit".
- [x] Menu selections: write the code for a switch-case structure that establishes separate code branches for each menu option.
- [x] Code branches: write placeholder within the menu item branches that provides user feedback until app features are developed.
- [x] Verification test: perform verification tests for the code that you develop in this exercise.

## List all of our current pet information

- [x] Outer loop: build the outer loop that iterates through the animals in the ourAnimals array.
- [x] Data check: write code that checks for existing pet data and displays the pet ID if data exists for a pet.
- [x] Inner loop: build an inner loop that displays all of the pet characteristics for pets with data assigned.
- [x] Verification test: perform verification tests for the code that you develop in this exercise.

## Build a test loop for entering new pet data

- [x] Calculate `petCount`: write code that counts the number of pets in the `ourAnimals` array that have assigned data.
- [x] Conditional messages: write code to display message output when `petCount` is less than `maxPets`.
- [ ] Outer loop: build a loop structure that will be used for entering new `ourAnimals` array data.
- [ ] Exit criteria: write code that evaluates the exit condition for the "enter new `ourAnimals` array data" loop.
- [ ] Verification test: perform verification tests for the code you develop in this exercise.
