# Review the intended output

When you have completed the required code edits, your application should produce the following output:

```Plain Text
Set contains 42
Total: 108
```

Complete the code updates required so that the existing `Console.WriteLine()` statements produce the desired output.

- Variable scope may need to be adjusted.

- Optimize your code for readability.

- Depending on the amount of whitespace that you include and some other factors, you should have around 17 lines of code.
